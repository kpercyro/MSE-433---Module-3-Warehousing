# MSE 433 - Module 3: Warehouse Conveyor Belt Optimization

Case study for MSE 433 exploring order consolidation on a 4-belt conveyor loop system at the IDEAS Clinic.

## Problem

A warehouse conveyor system has 4 belts forming a loop. Items are loaded onto a ramp, circulate on the conveyor, and pneumatic arms push items off when a scanner detects a match with the active order on that belt. The goal is to minimize the total time (makespan) to fulfill all orders by optimizing:

1. **Belt assignment** - which orders go on which belt and in what sequence
2. **Tote loading order** - the sequence items are physically placed on the ramp

## Approach Comparison

Jeevan and Kate each built independent SA-based optimizers with different abstractions for the same problem (seed=100, 11 orders, 36 items).

| Aspect | Jeevan | Kate |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Decision variables** | Belt assignment + loading sequence | Tote sequence + order priority |
| **Simulation model** | Physical timing (seconds), recirculation | Abstract tote-steps, circulation penalty |
| **SA structure** | Two-phase (belt SA, then loading strategy selection) | Single-phase joint SA |
| **Initialization** | LPT + SPT heuristic | Random shuffle |
| **Neighbor moves** | Insertion (50%), swap (30%), reversal (20%) | Tote swap or order swap (50/50) |
| **SA parameters** | T0=100, alpha=0.9997, 20K iters | T0=1000, cooling=0.995, 8K iters |

## Cross-Evaluation Results

Both solutions evaluated through **both** simulators, compared against a naive round-robin baseline:

| Solution | Makespan (s) | Total CT (s) | Kate Obj | Kate Circ |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Jeevan's SA | 374.0 | 2024.0 | 72.5 | 7 |
| Kate's SA | 374.0 | 2112.0 | 59.0 | 0 |
| Naive baseline | 446.0 | 3284.0 | 79.0 | 6 |

**Improvement over naive:**

| Solution | Makespan | Total CT | Kate Obj |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Jeevan's SA | +16.1% | +38.4% | +8.2% |
| Kate's SA | +16.1% | +35.7% | +25.3% |

Both optimizers achieve the same **16.1% makespan improvement** (374s vs 446s). Jeevan's solution edges out on total completion time (physical timing), while Kate's achieves zero circulation penalty in her abstract model.

### Running the comparison

```bash
python compare_solutions.py
```

This prints a full report to the terminal and writes `comparison_results.csv` with all metrics.
